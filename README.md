## 📊 Architecture & Design Patterns

- Event-driven architecture with message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- CQRS and event sourcing patterns
- Circuit breaker and resilience patterns
- Secrets rotation and certificate management
- Blue-green and canary deployment strategies
- Multi-region active-active deployments

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance Mindset

Every system I design prioritizes:
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal permissions, identity-based access control
- **Encryption**: Data in transit (TLS) and at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trails for compliance (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and patching cycles
- **Threat Modeling**: Proactive security analysis
